## Inspiration
To help people with a platform to cheer up while they are going through mental illness or stress.

People who suffer from mental illness needed a medium to talk, to express themselves, they needed support and motivation. So we provide a platform where they can select exercises according to their emotions. We also provide tasks and motivational quotes to cheer them up.

It was built using @sign primarily as the base platform. We used it to support our flutter frontend efficiently. We also built a website with displays quotes in the form of cards.
We also used Sawo API for passwordless authentication of the users.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced time management as one of our biggest challenges as we had lot of things in our mind to work on. We overcame it with good teamwork.
